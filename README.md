# Full Stack 101 Workshop
Code for Full Stack Beginners

## Run locally

This project is a simple static site. You can run it without any build tools.

- Option A: Open the site directly
	- Double-click `index.html`, or from PowerShell:

```powershell
Start-Process "$PWD/index.html"
```

- Option B: Serve with a tiny local server (optional)
	- If you have Python 3 installed, from the project folder run:

```powershell
python -m http.server 5500
```

	- Then open http://localhost:5500 in your browser.

If you use VS Code, the "Live Server" extension is another convenient option.
